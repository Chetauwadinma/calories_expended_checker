## About The Project
This project provides a simple web application that predicts the number of calories burned during an exercise session. It leverages a Machine Learning model (specifically, a Linear Regression model) trained on various fitness and demographic data to provide an estimate.

The goal is to offer a user-friendly tool for individuals to quickly estimate their calorie expenditure based on key activity metrics and personal attributes, which can be useful for fitness tracking, diet planning, or general curiosity.

## Features
Calorie Prediction: Predicts calories burned based on exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature (and potentially other factors like age, height, weight, gender if implemented in your model).

## Simple Web Interface: Easy-to-use form for inputting data and viewing predictions.

## Machine Learning Powered: Utilizes a pre-trained scikit-learn Linear Regression model for predictions.

## Scalable: Built with Flask, suitable for containerization and deployment.

## Demo
